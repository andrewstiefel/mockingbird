# Five Ways to Listen to a Mockingbird

The electronics for this piece can be run with a Max patch that includes reverberation, harmonizers, and that plays the pre-recorded sound files through a stereo sound system.

For requests or issues with the patch, please contact me at [andrew@andrewstiefel.net](mailto:andrew@andrewstiefel.net).

## Instructions

**1) Download the latest version of Max from Cycling 74.**

The latest version can be downloaded from [cycling74.com/downloads](https://cycling74.com/downloads). You do not need to pay for a license to use Max for performance.

**2) Download and save this repository to your local hard drive.**

Intel® Core™ i5 processor or faster recommended with 8 GB RAM or more. Works on 32-bit or 64-bit machines.

**3) Open fwl-electronics-v2.maxpat with Max and follow the instructions.**

After opening the patch, click the initialize button. This will load the audio files and activate playback. The patch includes an optional mapping for the AKAI APC 40 to be used as a control surface. 

## Performance Notes

Cues in the score must be triggered by a musician or engineer at the mixing board. In both rehearsal and performance the sound engineer/musician should read the score and adjust the levels of the instruments and electronics on the mixing board according to the size and acoustics of the performance space.

The amplification should never cover the acoustic sound of the instruments. Microphones should be placed as close to the instrument as possible to create a clear, close sound.
